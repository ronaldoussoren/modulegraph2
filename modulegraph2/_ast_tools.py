    Scan the AST for a module to look for import statements.

    The AST scanner gives the most detailed information about import statements,
    and includes information about renames (``import ... as ...``), and the
    location of imports (global, in a function, in a try/except statement, in a
    conditional statement).

    The scanner explicitly manages a work queue and will not recurse to avoid
    exhausting the stack.
